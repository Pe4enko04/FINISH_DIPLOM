          <p>He made his debut in print in 1952 with the story “Newsman Juyo” written in Russian (newspaper Komsomolets Kirgizii, April 6, 1952), after which he published stories in Kyrgyz and Russian. After graduating from the institute, he worked as a veterinarian for three years, while continuing to write and publish stories.

            In 1956 he entered the Higher Literary Courses in Moscow, from which he graduated in 1958. The story "Face to Face" in the Kyrgyz language was published in June 1957 in the magazine "Ala-Too" and the following year in the magazine "October" in the author's translation into Russian. In 1958, the story "Jamilya" was published, which brought Aitmatov world fame (and at the same time translated into French by Louis Aragon). In 1959-1965 he was the editor-in-chief of the Literary Kyrgyzstan magazine, at the same time he worked as his own correspondent for the Pravda newspaper in the Kirghiz SSR. Member of the CPSU since 1959.
            
            After "Jamili" the novels "Camel's Eye" (1960), "The First Teacher" (1961), "Mother's Field" (1963) and the collection "The Tale of Mountains and Steppes" (1963) were also published, for which the writer received the Lenin Prize. All these works were published simultaneously in Kyrgyz and Russian translations. In 1965, the story "The First Teacher" was filmed by Andrei Konchalovsky at Mosfilm, and "Camel's Eye" was also filmed by Larisa Shepitko with Bolot Shamshiev in the role of Kemel.

The story "The White Steamboat" (1970) was published in Russian; its adaptation was shown at international film festivals in Berlin and Venice. The joint work of Aitmatov with the Kazakh playwright Kaltay Mukhamedzhanov - the play "Climbing Mount Fuji" (1973) - still does not leave the theater stages of Kazakhstan.
