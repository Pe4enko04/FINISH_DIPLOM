          <h2>Personal life</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="section-title2">
          <p>The writer admired female beauty and deeply understood the female character. Proof of this are the authentically and convexly written images of women in the books of Chingiz Aitmatov: the strong Jamila from the story of the same name, the young romantic Asel (“My poplar in a red scarf”), wise Tolgonai, who lost her sons in the war, but retained the inner beauty of her soul ("Mother's Field").In almost every work there is that woman, from the appearance of which on the pages of the book it becomes brighter in the soul of the protagonist or reader. And in the life of the writer, female beauty played an important role. With his first wife, Kerez Shamshibayeva, Chingiz met while studying at the Agricultural Institute. The girl studied at the medical institute and was also interested in literature.

            After school, the excellent student Kerez even received a referral to the Moscow Literary Institute, but material circumstances did not allow her to leave. Kerez Shamshibaeva became an excellent doctor and leader, she worked at the Ministry of Health of Kyrgyzstan. She gave birth to two sons. Sanjar Chingizovich was born in 1954, he is a journalist and writer, businessman. Askar Chingizovich was born in 1959, became an oriental historian and public figure.
            In the late fifties, Chingiz Aitmatov met the main love of his life - the ballerina Bubusara Beishenalieva. The novel began in Leningrad and lasted fourteen years. The lovers could not get married: the high position of both required respect for decorum. A communist could not just divorce his wife for the sake of marriage with the People's Artist of the USSR, who was courted by the first people of the state.

            The experiences of the writer found a way out in his works. He is tormented by the need to make a choice between his wife and Tanabai's mistress in the story "Farewell, Gulsary". Falls in love with the widow of a friend Buranny Edigei in the novel "And the day lasts longer than a century." In both works, women are morally more stable than the lyrical hero, ready to run headlong for a new love.
            Fourteen years lasted a secret relationship, about which there was a lot of gossip in the republic. Bubusara Beishenalieva died on May 10, 1973 after a year and a half battle with breast cancer. Twenty years later, in collaboration with Mukhtar Shakhanov, Aitmatov wrote the book “Confession at the end of the century” (the second title is “The lament of the hunter over the abyss”), in which he frankly told the story of this love.

            The second wife of Chingiz Torekulovich was Maria Urmatovna. By the time she met the eminent writer, Maria managed to graduate from the screenwriting department of VGIK, get married and give birth to her daughter Cholpon. In the second marriage, the son Eldar and the daughter Shirin were born. Eldar Chingizovich graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgium, he is a designer and artist, and runs the Aitmatov House Museum in Bishkek.
